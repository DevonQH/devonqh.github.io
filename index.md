## About Me

I am a third-year student at the Computer Science and Technology Department, Tsinghua Univerisity. I like elegant mathematics and computational problems. I'm currently interested in **nonconvex optimization**. Moreover, you may find my cv [here](./my_cv.pdf).

## My Blogs

You may follow me at the [wordpress](https://devonsplace.wordpress.com/), where I'll discuss about my works.

## About My Research

I'm currently studying the **nonconvex optimization** problems. A very useful website can be attained [here (off the convex path)](http://www.offconvex.org/). And [here](./opt.pdf) is a helpful note on *convex optimization*.

Previously I've been working on projects using **reinforcement learning** techniques in optimizations of computer networks. Namely, they are as follows.

#### Using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in Text Summarization

++[[Github](https://github.com/DevonQH/RL_summ)]++ NLP Lab, THU.

###### In this project, we used hierarchical reinforcement learning method for text summarization, and achieved the state-of-art ROUGE score on NewYork Times dataset.

#### Using Reinforment Learning in TCP Initial Window Selection.

++[[Github](https://github.com/Alan-Nie/nginx)]++ Netman Lab, THU.

###### In this project, we used grouping algorithms for grouping clients and slide window UCB for initial window selection. Our algorithm can improve the network performance (rtt + latency) by up to 50 percent. Our algorithm are also used in online tests at Baidu's data centers and proved to improve by 10% in real cases.

## About My Life

My life is full of happiness and good luck. I have a great soul mate, Joris, who is also caring for my personal life. Our girl -- Teacher Cang -- a one-year-old hamster likes to chub woods. Also, our parents are quite warm-hearted and support our relationship.
