#Welcome to Qinghua Ding(Devon)'s Website

## About Me

I am a fourth-year student at the Computer Science and Technology Department, Tsinghua Univerisity. I like elegant maths and its applications in the computer science. I'm currently interested in nonconvex optimization. Moreover, you may find my cv [here](./my_cv.pdf).

## My Blogs

You may follow me at the [wordpress](https://devonsplace.wordpress.com/), where I'll discuss about my works.

## About My Research

I'm currently studying the nonconvex optimization problems. A very useful website can be attained [here (off the convex path)](http://www.offconvex.org/). And [here](./opt.pdf) is a helpful note on convex optimization.

Previously I've been working on projects using reinforcement learning techniques in optimizations of computer networks. Namely, they are as follows.

#### Using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in Text Summarization

[Github](https://github.com/DevonQH/RL_summ) NLP Lab, THU.

#### Using Reinforment Learning in TCP Initial Window Selection.

[Github](https://github.com/Alan-Nie/nginx) Netman Lab, THU.

And to note with honor, I joined the program of VDX at CMU last summer, and built a XIA-based VDX protocol for simulation, and [our work](./vdx.pdf) is PRIZE-WINNING at CoNext 2017. (Although not in the author list :-)

## Publications

My publications are mainly about optimization and mechanism design in content delivery networks, which is my PREVIOUS research interest.

## About My Life

My life is full of happiness and good luck. I have a great soul mate, Joris, who is also caring for my personal life. Our girl -- Teacher Cang, a one-year old hamster likes to chub woods. Also, our parents are quite warm-hearted and supports our relationship.
