### About Me

I am a gap-year student at Computer Science and Technology Department, Tsinghua Univerisity. I like elegant maths (shewwww...) and computer science. I'm currently interested in artificial intelligence and its applications in natural language processing[(NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) as well as system optimization.

Although the ML&DL techniques have been widely used and showed great performance, there is still some important logical part missing for supporting these methods. Although my current target is learn about the already-knowns in ML&DL, I do hope to study the hidden logics behind the magic in the future.

### Current Research

#### Intelligent TCP Initial Window Selection via Reinforcement Learning

The [TCP initial window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control) is a critical parameter in determining the transmitting speed of the files across the network. However, traditional congestion control algorihtms are too conservative about tuning this parameter, causing insufficient use of network capacity. We propose a RL-based centralised optimization framework for TCP initial window selection. The testbed-based experiment demostrate up to 100ms reduction in round trip time(rtt). The large-scale online experiment is ongoing in Baidu.com.

### Personal Life

My life is full of happiness and good luck. I have a good boyfriend, Joris, who is caring for my personal life. Our boys and girls -- Teacher Cang, a one-year old hamster and Blackie, a three-month old cat is celever and cute. Also, our parents are quite supportive and understanding of our relationship.
