## About Me

I am a fourth-year student at the Computer Science and Technology Department, Tsinghua Univerisity. I like elegant maths and its applications in the computer science. I'm currently interested in nonconvex optimization. Moreover, you may find my cv [here](./my_cv.pdf).

## About My Research

I'm currently studying the nonconvex optimization problems. A very useful website can be attained [here (off the convex path)](http://www.offconvex.org/).

[Here](./opt.pdf) is a helpful note on convex optimization.

## Publications

My publications are mainly about optimization and mechanism design in content delivery networks, which is my PREVIOUS research interest.

## About My Life

My life is full of happiness and good luck. I have a great soul mate, Joris, who is also caring for my personal life. Our girl -- Teacher Cang, a one-year old hamster likes to chub woods. Also, our parents are quite warm-hearted and supports our relationship.
